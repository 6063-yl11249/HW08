### Neon Mondrian  

*1. How are you detecting the colors?*  


*2. What are you changing them to?*  
I add the [Wavemaker](https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-wavemaker.html) effect to the painting.

*3. What happens if you run your sketch on images of different Mondrian paintings?*  
The effect applys to the different paintings. I created 4 buttons for users to switch different paintings.
