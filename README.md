### Neon Mondrian  

*1. How are you detecting the colors?*  
I created the function colorMatch (), and use a threshold to compare each of their three channels.

*2. What are you changing them to?*  
I add the [Wavemaker](https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-wavemaker.html) effect to the painting.

*3. What happens if you run your sketch on images of different Mondrian paintings?*  
I tried to apply the effect to different paintings, it works. The only problem is that if the color block is too small, then the Wavemaker effect cannot work very well.

### Visualizing Sound

*1. What song or sound did you pick?*
I chose Strawberries & Cigarettes by  Troye Sivan.  

*2. How are you visualizing its samples?*
First, I drew the CD of the album to rotate when playing the music. And then, I drew lines by using the peak of the song to create a waveform.
